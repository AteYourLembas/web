<![CDATA[11. How do the Clarks manage to forget their dog during a tornado in the first place? This scene actually worked pretty well so I don’t want to poop on it too much. Maybe the dog was Ma Kent’s responsibility. Stupid Ma Kent and her inability to get to overpasses.

I thought that scene was awful!  Why would Jonny go forget the dog in the first place.  Why would he insist on going back when it would have been totally safe for Clark to go back?  

why would he not at least throw himself to the ground?

That entire scene made no sense whatoever!!]]>

<![CDATA[My husband hated Man of Steel because he says it&#039;s biggest consistent theme is shame. I think I have simpler tastes, because while I thought a lot of aspects of it were downright stupid, my biggest disappointment was that the only proper kneeling before Zod was incidental postmortem kneeling.]]>
