		<description><![CDATA[Mamacita Maxima - Yelling is excellent for assaults or creeps from strangers, but I can&#039;t see this as a solution for a kid getting bullied. When you have to go to school with your attacker, you need long-term solutions. And self-defense works. Fortunately a bully is a different thing from a murderer.

freethoughtmom - I like your ideas about anger. I&#039;m working on a comic about feelings -- having them, recognizing them, expressing them -- and I hope to explore the broader scope of dealing with anger there. Thank you for your feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tory, I like your drawing style, how you get expression out of a set of eyes!

Why do you think that (male) bullies have low self-esteem? Isn&#039;t it more likely that s-word again, shame? (you&#039;ll see what I mean by googling &#039;bullies self-esteem&#039;).

Have you ever heard a teenager with the ability to say &#039;I am angry with you because ...&#039;?  Usually we teach our girls to &quot;nicely&quot; suppress anger and not voice it.  The book _Odd Girl Out_ brilliantly makes the case that this is the cause of female verbal bullying that we all remember from middle school.

Thanks for listening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not so sure about the fighting back, except in extremis. I mean, what happens when the bully takes that as a cue to pull out a shiv? I recommend bellowing like a banshee. If nothing else, it draws attention to the situation and it&#039;s amazing how people are deterred by facing a maniac.]]></description>
