<![CDATA[I just 11 and I showed this to all of my girlfriends, and they, as well as me, thought this was great advice! I haven&#039;t had to deal with a pervert yet, and I hope I don&#039;t have to. But if I do, I know what to do, thanks to this page full of advice! I can&#039;t stop reading it, even though I practically memorized it.]]>

<![CDATA[freethoughtmom -- I agree it&#039;s important that all kids exercise their right to be angry. It&#039;s a good conversation for another comic. My experience is that anger has a function but resentment is toxic. It must be dealt with. Forgiveness is not for the offender&#039;s benefit, but for the kid&#039;s.

Maybe that&#039;s a heady lesson for a kid who just got creeped on by a pervert, but it is the completely justified resentments that linger longest.]]>

<![CDATA[I like your comic, but, to my ear, the good is undone with the forgiveness and praying. You point out pervert&#039;s problems are pervert&#039;s -- your first commenter loved this part too! -- but then the contradiction: &#039;victim should internalize it &#038; do something about it&#039;.  Why can&#039;t she just be &#039;free&#039;?  And free to be angry!  Our cultural norm of swashing girl&#039;s anger into palatable &quot;nice&quot; is a huge, unrecognized problem.]]>

<![CDATA[This is so awesome.  I&#039;d had to deal with a few perverts in my life, and while I&#039;m older now, it was really hard to admit that it wasn&#039;t my fault.  If I have kids, I&#039;ll definitely show them this.]]>
