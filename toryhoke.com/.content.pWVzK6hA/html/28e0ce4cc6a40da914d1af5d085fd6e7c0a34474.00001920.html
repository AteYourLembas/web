<![CDATA[I would like to throw out the argument that Drago is brown because he&#039;s Mongolian. This actually makes a lot of sense in a historical manner as well since the Mongolians were sweeping across Siberia and much of eastern Europe in the middle ages. Further evidence for this comes from his human minions, many of which have clothing very similar to that worn by Mongolian and Siberian nomads, with a few North American&#039;s in there as well.

To be honest the Viking age was pretty much over by the time of the Mongol invasion but we can probably assume that the vikings in the movie are heavily disconnected with the mainland continent. 

As for the the Alpha&#039;s the black &#038; white good vs evil probably played into this, but the color&#039;s could also probably have come from nature. 

The &quot;good&quot; Alpha is a surface dwelling creature that resides in a northern landscape in a castle of ice. This habitat is very similar to the habitat of Polar Bears which are white.

The &quot;bad&quot; Alpha is an ocean dwelling creature that is actually more of a grayish green than black similar to many river fish and predators. Personally I think it should have been a lighter gray like that of sharks, but it still kinda fits.]]>

<![CDATA[Except he is the only black actor in the cast...just because you don&#039;t see the subtext doesn&#039;t mean it doesn&#039;t exist...movies have typically made villains brown or dark in contrast to their blue or green eyed heroes...white vs black is literary and metaphorical...if everyone should be as white as you say...then why is the villain dreadlocked and brownskinned? The villain should
be as white, blonde-haired as the the rest of the cast]]>

<![CDATA[Drago was trying to control all the kingdoms and asked that they all bow to him and he would protect them. When they didn&#039;t, he kills the clan leaders. That was his motivation.

As far as the only evil person is brown?.. how many Scandinavians are brown to begin with. They were vikings. As white a race as you can get. Even their food is white. Fish..potatoes.  and I&#039;m sure the actor wasn&#039;t the only black person who worked on the movie. It&#039;s animated, so it doesn&#039;t exactly have a huge cast of actors.

As far as the evil alpha Dragon being blackened and the other alpha being white... good versus evil has always traditionally been white vs. black. It&#039;s not racist. It&#039;s literary fashion.

Hope that helps. I did like rest of the article. I&#039;d drop the racism part. It&#039;s not a conspiracy.]]>
