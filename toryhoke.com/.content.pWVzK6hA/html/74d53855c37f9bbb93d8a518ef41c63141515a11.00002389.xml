					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry for what you&#039;re going through - and most especially that you secretly blame yourself. It&#039;s not your fault, and there&#039;s nothing more that you can do than what you&#039;ve been doing. (I say that simply because you can never hear that enough.) I hope you and your partner can figure out what&#039;s best for you, whatever that may be, and find peace in however you choose to make your family, with or without children. 

In the meantime, you might want to check out Project Pomegranate, which is a community for those suffering through infertility, pregnancy loss, and infant death - there&#039;s some wonderful writing there, and I think they&#039;d benefit from hearing your voice as well: http://projectpomegranate.org/ OR https://www.facebook.com/ProjectPomegranate/?fref=ts]]></description>

		Comment on 12 Lingering Questions about Star Trek Into Darkness by Brad Stansell		</title>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you ever actually seen the show or watched the movie?  
1. Kirk is known to be a horn-dog.  Not a pervert, but he gratuitously sleeps with women both on the show and in the movies.  Hence, he can&#039;t help but take a peek.  And you&#039;re saying that every woman who wears matching underwear is a slut?  Really?  
2. True.  But we&#039;re not sure how long the de-frosting process takes, or if all of his crew have the same healing properties that he has.  He is their leader for a reason.  And why would you want to awaken another psychopath when you already have one alive and well.  
3.  Because it&#039;s not a cell phone call.  Star Trek has been doing this kind of long distance communication for decades.  This isn&#039;t 2001: A Space Odyssey we&#039;re talking about.  Star Trek calls it sub-space, but who knows how it actually works?  Might as well complain that Warp Drive isn&#039;t a real form of travel.
4.  A. He doesn&#039;t wait until the last minute.  He WANTS the natives to chase him so they&#039;re out of the &#039;kill zone&#039;.  He even says that.  B.  Pike says specifically that they were there to observe and report... they&#039;re explorers, that&#039;s what they do.  Kirk exercised his own judgement when he noticed the volcano was going to kill them all.  C. They didn&#039;t have one handy, it&#039;s kind of implied that Spock was able to throw one together when Kirk ordered him to.
5.  Did you even notice how damaged the ship actually was?  Yeah, let&#039;s use robots when we have no power.  No central computer to tell the robots what needs fixing, no way to recharge said robots.  AI?  Sure.  Despite the fact that Star Trek has dealt with the artificial life vs. natural life issue on more than one occasion.  
6.  Kirk had radiation poisoning.  His body itself wasn&#039;t radioactive.  The hazmat-suit wearing guys were probably heading into the core to repair any other damage.  
7.  How was this &#039;way worse&#039;?  He wanted to save lives but knew that he would get in trouble for it.  Kirk is known for disobedience and exercising his own moral code.  
8.  Seriously?  Did you watch him kill Marcus?  I guess you haven&#039;t even seen this movie and all of these questions are based on random stills.  
9.  Vulcans are known to be physically superior to humans.  Kahn is a physically enhanced human, which puts them on even footing.  And Uhura is not the champion of &quot;No, Spock, it&#039;s too dangerous&quot;.  She drops him into a volcano at the beginning of the film saying &quot;You&#039;ve got this&quot;.  
10 and 11.  Did you miss that little insignificant part where Kirk asks for permission to go after Harrison?  Oh, and what about that little bit where Kahn explains that he hid his people in the torpedoes in order to smuggle them off-planet?  
12.  I guess you didn&#039;t care for The Avengers either.  Only movies where no one gets hurt are worth watching.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a few points of divergence here:
1. Anna, Elsa, and Rapunzel are supposed to look alike, although maybe not to the extent that they do-Anna and Elsa are sisters and Rapunzel is widely thought to be their cousin (but Disney&#039;s never confirmed or denied this). 
2. Jessie, being a doll, has a rounder face that distinguishes her from the humans. 
3. I think the DreamWorks heroines are modeled after their voice actresses, Reese Witherspoon (Ginormica-she has Reese&#039;s heart-shaped face) and Tina Fey (Roxanne).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to throw out the argument that Drago is brown because he&#039;s Mongolian. This actually makes a lot of sense in a historical manner as well since the Mongolians were sweeping across Siberia and much of eastern Europe in the middle ages. Further evidence for this comes from his human minions, many of which have clothing very similar to that worn by Mongolian and Siberian nomads, with a few North American&#039;s in there as well.

To be honest the Viking age was pretty much over by the time of the Mongol invasion but we can probably assume that the vikings in the movie are heavily disconnected with the mainland continent. 

As for the the Alpha&#039;s the black &#038; white good vs evil probably played into this, but the color&#039;s could also probably have come from nature. 

The &quot;good&quot; Alpha is a surface dwelling creature that resides in a northern landscape in a castle of ice. This habitat is very similar to the habitat of Polar Bears which are white.

The &quot;bad&quot; Alpha is an ocean dwelling creature that is actually more of a grayish green than black similar to many river fish and predators. Personally I think it should have been a lighter gray like that of sharks, but it still kinda fits.]]></description>
