I will pretend they stole my idea, but some of these are not trying to be &#8220;sexy&#8221; costumes (the penguin) or costumes at all (the PETA bloody-woman-as-meat), so really these&#8230; <a href="/2008/10/30/death-of-sexy-well-well-well-well/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Death of Sexy: Well.

I could sincerely see reversing it mid-party &#8212; p&#8217;raps starting as an angel and then converting to devil round midnight when the shot glasses come out.

<![CDATA[<p>From Trashy Lingerie To be fair, is this a costume or is it lingerie? It is incredibly short to be worn out of doors. Yet it is $350 &#8212; NOT INCLUDING SHOES. I think everyone involved needs a good talking-to.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Time for a sexy costume hiatus from excessive politics. And here it be: I&#8217;m not sure why this costume bothers me. I think it&#8217;s the fact that nothing about it is boxery except for the gloves. Take away the gloves, and this woman is costumed as, perhaps, a piece of candy?

Perhaps this is a new concept, where a sexy lady is put in a jail like cheese in a mousetrap, and a dude who jumped bail is lured back.
