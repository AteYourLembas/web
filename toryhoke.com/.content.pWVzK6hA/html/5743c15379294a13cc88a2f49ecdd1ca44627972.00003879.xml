<p>Production is complete on <b>Mari Muerta</b>, and updates will be posted as we go. But we still have a long way to go, from editing to festival fees, and every bit counts.</p>
<p>So what is this one about?</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Synopsis (spoilers, of course):</b></p>
<blockquote><p>
Comic book artist Bert comes home from a lackluster job interview to find his house turned upside-down by a poltergeist&#8230; again. When Mariquita manifests, J-Horror style, Bert barely looks up from his spaghetti dinner. Still, as the two recap their day, he agrees to play a game with her – until his phone rings.</p>
<p>The job interview was a success. They want to see the first page by the morning.</p>
<p>Bert has to decide – work or Battleship? Work wins, hands down. Hurt, Mari tries everything she can to prevent him from finishing – overturning his spaghetti, throwing furniture, putting out the light – to no avail. She leaves him alone – and happy to be so.</p>
<p>Deep in the night, he finally finishes and goes to bed. His phone drags him back to the office, though, as the recruiter wants to know how it went.</p>
<p>He finds his precious page destroyed – by Mari.</p>
<p>Furious, Bert rants and fumes in the empty room. He doesn&#8217;t see Mari appear until he&#8217;s already said something terrible – and something she&#8217;s been told before.</p>
<p>What happens next is far beyond Mari&#8217;s regular disturbances.</p>
<p>Once things settle down (and he finds a flashlight), Bert begs Mari to let him talk to her. She eventually permits him to join her in her sacred space &#8212; the linen closet. There, Bert learns the real source of Mari&#8217;s emotions – she left behind a little sister. Mari&#8217;s afraid her sister&#8217;s childhood is turning out no better than her own.</p>
<p>Bert realizes how Mari can contact her father. Together, they write him a letter.</p>
<p>No sooner has Mari sealed the envelope than she begins to cross over! Goodbye, Mari. The house is empty.</p>
<p>Now alone, Bert honors Mari&#8217;s memory – with her own comic book, and with one more overturned bowl of spaghetti. </p></blockquote>
<p>And what&#8217;s the point?</p>
<p>That there are fates worse than death. Like being forgotten.</p>
