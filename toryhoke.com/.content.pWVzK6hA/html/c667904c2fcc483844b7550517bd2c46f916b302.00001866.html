<![CDATA[It&#039;s possible to take this social commentary stuff too far. For example, the idea of &#039;people of colour&#039; (horrible pc expression) being marginalised is reading too much into it; try to remember that the movie was basically set in Denmark or Norway several centuries ago, so the main speaking characters are bound to be mostly North-European-looking. That&#039;s not prejudice, that&#039;s just the setting.

As another example, your analysis of Elsa&#039;s character hinting at some &#039;sexual awakening&#039; is again reading far too much into it. This is a film which was designed knowing that children would be watching, so it is highly unlikely the designers intended that. More likely Elsa&#039;s behaviour can be described as &#039;confident&#039;. I think you really need to lighten up and stop over analysing.]]>

<![CDATA[Interesting post about Elsa&#039;s father. Maybe his parenting decisions were based on being a King vs being a dad: http://justadadwithquestions.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/was-elsas-dad-so-wrong/]]>
