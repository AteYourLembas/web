<![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen that thing in person. It&#039;ll give you nightmares. They might as well have H.R. Giger do the designs for the new wing at the children&#039;s hospital.

&quot;Oh, what&#039;s that? Little Timmy has the sniffles? Well, just take him down to the clinic. It&#039;s right through that door that looks like a screaming, saber-toothed vagina, to the right through the hallway that&#039;s made of spinal columns dripping a viscous goo, and into the room that looks like an alien penis turned inside-out. If you get lost, just look for the ELP album cover.&quot;]]>
