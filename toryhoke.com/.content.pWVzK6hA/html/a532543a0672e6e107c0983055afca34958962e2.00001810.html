<![CDATA[Just a few points of divergence here:
1. Anna, Elsa, and Rapunzel are supposed to look alike, although maybe not to the extent that they do-Anna and Elsa are sisters and Rapunzel is widely thought to be their cousin (but Disney&#039;s never confirmed or denied this). 
2. Jessie, being a doll, has a rounder face that distinguishes her from the humans. 
3. I think the DreamWorks heroines are modeled after their voice actresses, Reese Witherspoon (Ginormica-she has Reese&#039;s heart-shaped face) and Tina Fey (Roxanne).]]>

<![CDATA[So this movie, which you criticise for being too undiverse, features Finns, Sami, Norwegians, Danes and Swedes. That&#039;s &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; different ethnicities.
They could easily have gotten away with making them all Danes, so they sort of went above and beyond here.

What is the measure of diversity then? Is it just skincolours? If that&#039;s the case, then is not the diversity you seek also just skin-deep?
Do we have to have 14 different cultures just to make a decent story?

I&#039;m not saying this to be difficult, I just find it strange that you pontificate about a lack of diversity in a movie that featured five distinct ethnicities.]]>

<![CDATA[Just want to get it in here, Rapunzel, Elsa and Anna: related. The mothers are sisters or something like that (do a google search for it, you&#039;ll find the fan theories)
But yes homogeneous female characters is a bad thing (I&#039;m not sure I used that word correctly...) but as long as we keep criticizing the movie creators for it it will ultimate get better. Just don&#039;t think less of the message of the movies just because the characters happens to fall into the category of looking to much like each other.
However I would like to argue that it&#039;s not as big of an issue as some people makes it out to be but it&#039;s still an important issue and people that makes movies should be aware of it. The industry around computer animated movies is still kinda new while the hand drawn part has had a couple of decades more to work out the kinks, I say give it a couple of years while we keep reminding them of the issues and they will figure it out eventually (stuff takes time deal with it!)]]>

<![CDATA[I don&#039;t see why it&#039;s so terrible for Elsa and Anna to have the same design with only superficial differences. They&#039;re sisters, with the same mother and same father - siblings often look alike.
The others, yes, should be more distinct.]]>

<![CDATA[Thanks so much for breaking down what goes into these depictions! I watched Frozen recently and had trouble connecting with the characters and felt the characterization was underdeveloped. In retrospect, I&#039;ve had the same feeling about many of the characters you describe here.  They seemed so... formless, uniform, stereotypical, in a way that made it hard to care about their stories or remember who they are later.  I loved &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, and loads of 2D animated films, so it&#039;s not that I&#039;m a curmudgeon. The studios seriously need to figure out how to illustrate women as individuals.]]>
