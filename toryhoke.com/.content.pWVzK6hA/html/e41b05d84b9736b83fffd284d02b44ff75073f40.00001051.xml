					<description><![CDATA[Lance, she&#039;s called &quot;Supergirl&quot; because... she&#039;s a girl. The first few incarnations of her character all appeared alongside a young Clark Kent who was referred to as Superboy and not Superman. Superboy was a retro look at the already-established Superman character, but because Supergirl was introduced as a teenage character, she was never allowed to &quot;grow up.&quot; Her character in later incarnations appeared more of a 20s-ish woman, but retained the Supergirl name.

					<description><![CDATA[When the Flickr blog featured comic con yesterday, I clicked through on one of the pictures and kept clicking hoping to see dragon con levels of costume madness, but didn&#039;t expect to find pictures of someone I know dressed as a Supergirl. (Why is this character&#039;s name not Super Woman? I assumed that there must be a separate SW character, but found only a few references after as many as 30 seconds searching the web.) I shared the photos with a couple of mutual acquaintances, but I stopped after a couple because I wasn&#039;t getting the &quot;OMGWTF it&#039;s crazy that the world is so small, you know?&quot; response I expected. I guess I was just hoping to re-live the absurdity of the moment, but it&#039;s true what they say (that you can&#039;t recreate absurdity by showing friends pictures of people they know dressed as comics characters).]]></description>
