					<description><![CDATA[Ha ha ha. I will get my caboose in gear.

I did end up catching the high frame rate, and it was mighty weird on the live action stuff, but all the digital monsters and things weren&#039;t weird, like the eyeball has totally different expectations for a live-action human versus a digitally animated goblin. Anyhoo this article about frame rates was mighty interesting:

					<description><![CDATA[What up pimpin&#039;! Not to be a pushy anonymouse follower of your blog, but I will be, where is The Hobbit Movie Review? After your Prometheus breakdown, and I mean I broke down, I was ready for a Tory Pimp Slap of some new hollywood lore. I personally liked it, the fluffing at the beginning really didn&#039;t get me as hot for the action that followed as it should have, but once the midget entourage got their adventure on, I was engaged! I didn&#039;t watch the 3D version, so no clue how the sports TV setting enhances or cripples the medium. It&#039;s no Man with the Iron Fists, a RZA cornucopia of train wrecks (I genuinely liked it, but half of it was left on the cutting room floor, whotf is that guy?), but I&#039;m looking forward to part deux! Hope it makes it on your plate, if not, happy holidays to you and your sister, big up LHS Devilpups, represent!!!]]></description>
