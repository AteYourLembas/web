		<description><![CDATA[Ok, it&#039;s been three years since this post and the world has changed, but I found a stupid, but seemingly working, way to have my app bundle embed the *svg* plugins, which wasn&#039;t included by default, and btw to fix the &quot;you might be loading two sets of Qt binaries” infamous error. Your post helped me on the first part with the pointer to macdeployqt, I found out that the best, although dirty, way to finally achieve my end was :

1. python3 setup.py py2app
2. macdeployqt dist/Tkacz.app 
(Ignore the long “WARNING: Could not find any external (...) before trying again.”
3. cp /Developer/Applications/Qt/plugins/imageformats/libqsvg.dylib dist/Tkacz.app/Contents/PlugIns/imageformats/
4. macdeployqt dist/Tkacz.app (Yes, again. That&#039;s because I haven&#039;t found a way to make it aware of the need to embed the SVG lib, but the app crashes after manual embedding. The second run seems to fix that.).

Maybe this may be helpful to someone struggling inside this strange asylum of bundling  PyQt apps for osx.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Useless? No! Bizarre? Yes. Smelling of overkill? Quite. But ReportLab turned my application from broken to unbroken after a half day of pure *headdesk* -- and for that I will buy them a beer.
Thank you for the advice to ask pythonmac. I should do that. I&#039;ve seen most of my PyQt workarounds cause temporary euphoria and long-term coming-back-to-bite-you -- I can hardly expect this one to be different.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, in this case, at least, I think the issue is with OS-X vs. Windows, rather than py2app vs. py2exe.

In generally, Windows is very sloppy with linking, which results in dll hell, but does sometimes make things like this easier to do.

As for your problem -- that is a useless work-around if you want to write an app that can open a jpeg, which would be a pretty reasonable thing to want to do.

There has got to be a solution, however. I don&#039;t know a thing about QT, and not much about the inner workings of linking on the Mac, but there are people that do on the pythomac list -- I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen you there -- it&#039;s worth posting a question.

		<description><![CDATA[Me and a coworker were just talking today about how py2exe seems to handle things better than py2app (also/as a result of more users, more documentation, more helper apps, etc.) I&#039;m glad you got py2exe to bend to your will. I look forward to seeing what develops for Python on Mac.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After hours of stumbling around with the same issue, I&#039;d like to share the that worked for me on windows:
using python2.6

copy the following directory into your dist directory generated by py2exe:
C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\plugins\imageformats

I just dropped the imageformats directory directly into my dist directory, without any further modifications to qt.conf or anything like that. I haven&#039;t tried it, but this may work for phonon as well.]]></description>
