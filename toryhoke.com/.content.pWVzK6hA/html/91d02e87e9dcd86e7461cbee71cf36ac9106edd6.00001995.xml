		<description><![CDATA[1. Movie takes place during global collapse 3 or 4. Six billion people died during the first one.

2. Makes no sense.

3. AIs do most of the work. Humans just like patting themselves on the back and being maudlin, apparently.

4. Could be local taxes. Would almost have to be a food/labor/fuel-based tax, since I can&#039;t imagine currency being worth much.

5. At least there&#039;s a suggestion of a drive between Kansas and Colorado. The movie also implies enough shit&#039;s gone down that a NASA-trained pilot (who isn&#039;t air force?) doesn&#039;t know what or where NORAD is.

6. Because most people have trouble visualizing it anyway, plus he had to come up with it on the spot while trapped behind a bookshelf like a twist ending to a Goosebumps book.

7. ... --.- ..- .- .-. . / .-. --- --- -


8. Maybe they dragged their asses out of bed because an extremely qualified pilot stumbled upon the most secure installation in existence and they have a policy too look out for potential cross-dimensional interference like that.

9. It was probably going to be Anne Hathaway and TARS.

10. Cheyenne Mountain.

11. They already knew that they didn&#039;t do that so they couldn&#039;t do that because time is a flat circle.

12. Same place they got extremely advanced AI, I guess. Scientific advancement in IVF.

13. They went in barely scraped together bare-bones craft (and I don&#039;t think they even went together).

14. Water-planet lady ate it immediately, Matt Damon spent a lot of time asleep (conserving rations/energy/everything), Wolfgang or whoever he was didn&#039;t eat enough, it would seem.

15. You  skipped 15.

16. The robot told him.

17. They don&#039;t have scanners or any of that magic-Trek tech, so they would&#039;ve had to observe the waves directly. Which you wouldn&#039;t think would&#039;ve been visisble. They were also relying on bad data that seemed to say that the water on the surface was flat and shallow and had been for years.

18. He seemed pretty fucked up by the whole thing. They had a shitload of food with them. Enough to jumpstart a colony.

19. I want to drown whoever came up with &quot;Quantum mechanics is love&quot; in a fucking toilet.

20. Everyone was glad thay guy died. His facial hair and demeanor were unsettling. 

21. Yeah, but this is a woman in a Nolan movie. I guess we&#039;re supposed to feel grateful that she even exists and can speak.

22. Yeah, he&#039;s a really shitty dad. But I suppose those 5th dimension super-people were too busy to manipulate time and space to fix 2 relationships.

23. Also, what can you glean from a low-quality stethoscope that tells you someone&#039;s lungs have less than an hour or so before they... disintegrate? Pop? &quot;SOMETHING BAD MEDICINE DIE LUNG DUST!&quot;

24. Yeah, I don&#039;t know what the fuck&#039;s going on there. She was probably as shitty a mom as Coop was a dad.

25. Forgot to swap out pages from an earlier draft that had cooler stuff with AIs in it.

26. I figured that in weird post-collapse america they&#039;d give people names like Professor and Chief and Doctor to encourage their kids to remember the past. Nah, that&#039;s dumb. Just like this movie.

27. When they unzipped his bag, I kind of expected someone to say, &quot;Holy shit. Is that... is that Matt Damon?&quot; maybe in the director&#039;s cut.

28. I started reading The Stand around that age...]]></description>
