<![CDATA[Have you ever actually seen the show or watched the movie?  
1. Kirk is known to be a horn-dog.  Not a pervert, but he gratuitously sleeps with women both on the show and in the movies.  Hence, he can&#039;t help but take a peek.  And you&#039;re saying that every woman who wears matching underwear is a slut?  Really?  
2. True.  But we&#039;re not sure how long the de-frosting process takes, or if all of his crew have the same healing properties that he has.  He is their leader for a reason.  And why would you want to awaken another psychopath when you already have one alive and well.  
3.  Because it&#039;s not a cell phone call.  Star Trek has been doing this kind of long distance communication for decades.  This isn&#039;t 2001: A Space Odyssey we&#039;re talking about.  Star Trek calls it sub-space, but who knows how it actually works?  Might as well complain that Warp Drive isn&#039;t a real form of travel.
4.  A. He doesn&#039;t wait until the last minute.  He WANTS the natives to chase him so they&#039;re out of the &#039;kill zone&#039;.  He even says that.  B.  Pike says specifically that they were there to observe and report... they&#039;re explorers, that&#039;s what they do.  Kirk exercised his own judgement when he noticed the volcano was going to kill them all.  C. They didn&#039;t have one handy, it&#039;s kind of implied that Spock was able to throw one together when Kirk ordered him to.
5.  Did you even notice how damaged the ship actually was?  Yeah, let&#039;s use robots when we have no power.  No central computer to tell the robots what needs fixing, no way to recharge said robots.  AI?  Sure.  Despite the fact that Star Trek has dealt with the artificial life vs. natural life issue on more than one occasion.  
6.  Kirk had radiation poisoning.  His body itself wasn&#039;t radioactive.  The hazmat-suit wearing guys were probably heading into the core to repair any other damage.  
7.  How was this &#039;way worse&#039;?  He wanted to save lives but knew that he would get in trouble for it.  Kirk is known for disobedience and exercising his own moral code.  
8.  Seriously?  Did you watch him kill Marcus?  I guess you haven&#039;t even seen this movie and all of these questions are based on random stills.  
9.  Vulcans are known to be physically superior to humans.  Kahn is a physically enhanced human, which puts them on even footing.  And Uhura is not the champion of &quot;No, Spock, it&#039;s too dangerous&quot;.  She drops him into a volcano at the beginning of the film saying &quot;You&#039;ve got this&quot;.  
10 and 11.  Did you miss that little insignificant part where Kirk asks for permission to go after Harrison?  Oh, and what about that little bit where Kahn explains that he hid his people in the torpedoes in order to smuggle them off-planet?  
12.  I guess you didn&#039;t care for The Avengers either.  Only movies where no one gets hurt are worth watching.]]>

<![CDATA[Seriously, can we talk about why the Enterprise, designed to orbit planets, went down into the atmosphere and UNDER WATER in order to help hide it form the natives? Since when do natives have telescopes and or radar that might locate a ship in orbit? Is there a reason the magic volcano killing device could not be TRANSPORTED to the planet on location? How about you drop it and activate it BY REMOTE CONTROL? Why doesn&#039;t the Enterprise, without the power to stop falling into the atmosphere at the end of the movie, NOT BURN UP in said atmosphere? 
And I&#039;m just warming up, folks...]]>
