		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Rick! Keep coming by and I will certainly keep delivering niche nerdery.

I am aware of FX though I haven&#039;t seen it since I was old enough to understand it. Maybe I should check it out again due to Bryan Brown is underrated. 

Unrelated -- did Lead Balloon really go on the roof of the Rosslyn Hotel at magic hour just to get excellent production team pictures? Because that would not impress me at all. Nope.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is my favorite so far! Very good writing in this one. Never thought there would be a comic about VFX! Keep it up!

On another note, remember the movie FX? About the Effects Specialist that is framed and wanted by the police? And FX2? Crazy.]]></description>
