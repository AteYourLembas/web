		<description><![CDATA[Hello Thetoryparty,
Along the same lines,, In order to deal with and avoid tonsil-stones you first needs to figure out what they are. The tonsils are structures that are terribly much like glands that are found at the back of the throat. Each one aspect of the throat homes a tonsil and tonsils possess tissue that is prepared up of cells labeled as lymphocytes that are there to avert as nicely as fight any infection that invades the mouth.
BTW great blogpost]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh you Brits are funny!  I think the best method is to get a dropper (medicine dropper) and suck some hydrogen peroxide H2O2 into it, and with a light and mirror release (drop) some in a crypt or if it&#039;s already poking out, on the tonsillith.  It should dissolve and make it easier to pop out, or if it seemed like an empty crypt, stuff may come out of it!! I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m sharing this--it&#039;s like a weird underground cult, lol.  Tonsils bleed easily so be careful with all that poking with sharp things!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WOW!!! I never knew there were other people that had ths problem like me.  Im glad I finally googled the little guys on my tonsil.  And ya about the whole dairy thing I dont think thats the way to solve it because I get these little guys every year and I cant have dairy because Im lactose intolerrant. :( but I will for sure try the toothpick trick. And ya I hate the smell as well.  I always just drank lots of nyquil and brushed about 10 times a day when they would pop up that worked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had tonsil stones for years, noticed the crypts would get worse if I drank acidic drinks like pop so I stuck to water.  Added to this, I had recurrent tonsilitis and 4 days ago I finally got my tonsils removed.  I heard that this will not stop the stones from comin but i&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed though.]]></description>
