					<description><![CDATA[Way back when, I worked for a grocery store. We had these giant rolls of industrial wrap as well. My husband and I once wrapped a friends car, in the blistering Florida heat, while said friend was working a 12 hour shift. We then covered the wrap with veggie oil so that you could not grip the wrap with too much ease. Ahhhh pranks. Glorious wrapping pranks :) I LOVE INDUSTRIAL WRAP AND ALL THOSE WHO USE IT WITH EVIL INTENTIONS :)]]></description>
